# algo-comp

This composer lets you add multiple streams of notes, which can be 
produced by different instruments, provided by the Tone.js library. 
This is done by creating a stream on balls that bounce off a base. 
There are controls for the instrument, the size of the balls in the 
visualization, and the speed and bounce of the balls, that affect 
the sound.

<b>Instructions:</b> <br>
  ♪ Choose a desired radius for each shape in px (range: 1-20) 
  (default: 10) <br> 
  ♪ Select an instrument for each new sound (default: Synth) <br>
  ♪ Change controls for the speed and bounce of the shapes 
  (speed range: 0.001-0.008, default speed: 0.005, bounce range: 0.001-0.01, 
  default bounce: 0.005) <br>
